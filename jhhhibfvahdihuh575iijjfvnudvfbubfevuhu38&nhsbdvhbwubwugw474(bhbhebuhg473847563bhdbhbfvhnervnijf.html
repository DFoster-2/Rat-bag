      <h1>The Creation story</h1>
      <p>The Great Ratbag bestowed the gift of life on to this world in the year 8401 BC, when rats were created. These holy beings are to be cherished, as they created mankind and all of the animals. The Great Ratbag - the holiest being in all of the universe - is to be praised as it created the holiest object in all of existence - the bin - yes, you heard it right. These holy objects are the food source for all of ratkind. So do not think lowly of them.
Prayer
The place of prayer for Ratbag Religion is by the nearest holy bin. You shall pray by making a shape with your hands by touching your index and thumb together on both hands and placing your hands next to each other.</p>
